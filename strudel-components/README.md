# STRUDEL Components

STRUDEL Components are a set of react components that support people developing UI applications for the scientific community. They are built on top of [Material UI components](https://mui.com/) and aim to provide an extra layer of implementation to promote positive user experiences and usability standards.

Key Features:
- Specialized data grid for displaying scientific data
- Chemical formula rendering component
- Filters component for managing complex filter states
